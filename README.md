## Overview
This is a Dash web app which Analysis the terrorism patterns throught the world.

## Motivation
What to do when you are at home due to this pandemic situation? I started to learn Data Analysis and Data Sciense to get most out of it. I came to know various EDA methods and Analysis modules. Finally it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.8.5. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://github.com/jyothiprakashpanaik/Terrorism-Analysis-with-Insights) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dash
***Dash is a Python framework for building analytical web applications. No JavaScript required.***
```bash
pip install Dash
```

Built on top of Plotly.js, React and Flask, Dash ties modern UI elements like dropdowns, sliders, and graphs directly to your analytical Python code. Read our tutorial proudly crafted ❤️ by [Dash itself](https://pypi.org/project/dash/).
